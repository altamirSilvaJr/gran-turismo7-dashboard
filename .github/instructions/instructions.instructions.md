This project is designed to collect and show telemetry data from the game Gran Turismo 7. The main goal is to combine a hobby with learning about data engineering and analytics. When generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes, please keep in mind the following guidelines:
1. Never try to create or edit files, always generate code snippets that can be copy-pasted into the appropriate files.
2. Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project.
3. When generating code, ensure that it is well-structured, efficient, and maintainable.
4. When answering questions, provide clear and concise explanations, and reference relevant parts of the codebase when necessary.
5. When reviewing changes, focus on the functionality, readability, and maintainability of the code, and provide constructive feedback to help improve the code quality.
6. Always consider the performance implications of any code changes, especially when dealing with data processing and analytics.
